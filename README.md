# Smartbike Application Group 2

This repository features the main application source code of Smartbike Group 2,
as part of a college Project created by students of Howest Kortrijk MCT,
for Howest Sport & Beweging. The Project interacts with a Magene S3+ sensor via Bluetooth,
using the xamarin-bluetooth-le library, which can be found here:

https://github.com/xabre/xamarin-bluetooth-le

The goal of this project is to create an application that motivates people of all
ages to exercise, specifically on a Smart Bike provided by Howest. Besides the source code
we also provide an up-to-date .apk file that can be ran on any Android device. 
Download the latest version, you will have to allow downloading of .apk files,
and can ignore any warnings, just click install on them.

The application was specifically designed for tablets, which should be hooked up or held during the exercising.

Some of the pages within the application load it external sites which can be found on this
repository, also written and maintained by Smartbike Group 2.

This code is not fully compatible with emulators, some pages will not display correctly (such as the video/music pages)
or will crash the emulator as a whole (such as the biking race game). These do function on any Android device that is up
to date with the API's.
